It does not provide a user interface. Once started, a service might continue running for some time, even after the user switches to another application. Additionally, a component can bind to a service to interact with it and even perform interprocess communication (IPC). For example, a service can handle network transactions, play music, perform file I/O, or interact with a content provider, all from the background.  Caution: A service runs in the main thread of its hosting process; the service does not create its own thread and does not run in a separate process unless you specify otherwise. You should run any blocking operations on a separate thread within the service to avoid Application Not Responding (ANR) errors.  Types of Services These are the three different types of services:  Foreground A foreground service performs some operation that is noticeable to the user. For example, an audio app would use a foreground service to play an audio track. Foreground services must display a Notification. Foreground services continue running even when the user isn&apos;t interacting with the app.  When you use a foreground service, you must display a notification so that users are actively aware that the service is running. This notification cannot be dismissed unless the service is either stopped or removed from the foreground.  Learn more about how to configure foreground services in your app.  Note: The WorkManager API offers a flexible way of scheduling tasks, and is able to run these jobs as foreground services if needed. In many cases, using WorkManager is preferable to using foreground services directly.  Background A background service performs an operation that isn&apos;t directly noticed by the user. For example, if an app used a service to compact its storage, that would usually be a background service. Note: If your app targets API level 26 or higher, the system imposes restrictions on running background services when the app itself isn&apos;t in the foreground. In most situations, for example, you shouldn&apos;t access location information from the background. Instead, schedule tasks using WorkManager.  Bound A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService(). A bound service offers a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service, send requests, receive results, and even do so across processes with interprocess communication (IPC). A bound service runs only as long as another application component is bound to it. Multiple components can bind to the service at once, but when all of them unbind, the service is destroyed. Although this documentation generally discusses started and bound services separately, your service can work both ways—it can be started (to run indefinitely) and also allow binding. It&apos;s simply a matter of whether you implement a couple of callback methods: onStartCommand() to allow components to start it and onBind() to allow binding.  Regardless of whether your service is started, bound, or both, any application component can use the service (even from a separate application) in the same way that any component can use an activity—by starting it with an Intent. However, you can declare the service as private in the manifest file and block access from other applications. This is discussed more in the section about Declaring the service in the manifest.  Choosing between a service and a thread A service is simply a component that can run in the background, even when the user is not interacting with your application, so you should create a service only if that is what you need.  If you must perform work outside of your main thread, but only while the user is interacting with your application, you should instead create a new thread in the context of another application component. For example, if you want to play some music, but only while your activity is running, you might create a thread in onCreate(), start running it in onStart(), and stop it in onStop(). Also consider using thread pools and executors from the java.util.concurrent package or Kotlin coroutines instead of the traditional Thread class. See the Threading on Android document for more information about moving execution to background threads.  Remember that if you do use a service, it still runs in your application&apos;s main thread by default, so you should still create a new thread within the service if it performs intensive or blocking operations.  The basics To create a service, you must create a subclass of Service or use one of its existing subclasses. In your implementation, you must override some callback methods that handle key aspects of the service lifecycle and provide a mechanism that allows the components to bind to the service, if appropriate. These are the most important callback methods that you should override:  onStartCommand() The system invokes this method by calling startService() when another component (such as an activity) requests that the service be started. When this method executes, the service is started and can run in the background indefinitely. If you implement this, it is your responsibility to stop the service when its work is complete by calling stopSelf() or stopService(). If you only want to provide binding, you don&apos;t need to implement this method. onBind() The system invokes this method by calling bindService() when another component wants to bind with the service (such as to perform RPC). In your implementation of this method, you must provide an interface that clients use to communicate with the service by returning an IBinder. You must always implement this method; however, if you don&apos;t want to allow binding, you should return null. onCreate() The system invokes this method to perform one-time setup procedures when the service is initially created (before it calls either onStartCommand() or onBind()). If the service is already running, this method is not called. onDestroy() The system invokes this method when the service is no longer used and is being destroyed. Your service should implement this to clean up any resources such as threads, registered listeners, or receivers. This is the last call that the service receives. If a component starts the service by calling startService() (which results in a call to onStartCommand()), the service continues to run until it stops itself with stopSelf() or another component stops it by calling stopService().  If a component calls bindService() to create the service and onStartCommand() is not called, the service runs only as long as the component is bound to it. After the service is unbound from all of its clients, the system destroys it.  The Android system stops a service only when memory is low and it must recover system resources for the activity that has user focus. If the service is bound to an activity that has user focus, it&apos;s less likely to be killed; if the service is declared to run in the foreground, it&apos;s rarely killed. If the service is started and is long-running, the system lowers its position in the list of background tasks over time, and the service becomes highly susceptible to killing—if your service is started, you must design it to gracefully handle restarts by the system. If the system kills your service, it restarts it as soon as resources become available, but this also depends on the value that you return from onStartCommand(). For more information about when the system might destroy a service, see the Processes and Threading document.  In the following sections, you&apos;ll see how you can create the startService() and bindService() service methods, as well as how to use them from other application components."
